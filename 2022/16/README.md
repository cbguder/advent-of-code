# Note on Part 2

I was unable to come up with a deterministic solution to Part 2 that runs in a reasonable amount of time.

The solution in part2.py is non-deterministic (due to the random ordering of neighbors in a set) and will often pick a non-optimal solution, but it runs reasonably quickly on my machine (~10s).

I ran variations of this code repeatedly and submitted the best results I saw until I found the right answer.
